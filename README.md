# Heart-Disease-ML-Model
This is project based on a  problem of the famous heart-disease classification and making a fully functioning ML model based on it .This was my first ever classification ml project.

Some things related to the project-:
* Accuracy of 90% obtained using Logistic Regression Algorithm
* Algorithms tried - KNearestNeighbors, RandomForestClassifer and LogisticRegression
* Full ML pipeline exceuted from gathering data to modelling and experimentation.
